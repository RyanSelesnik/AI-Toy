  utter_what_possible:
    - text: "We can play the memory game, called I went to the Market and I Bought... or we can play the math game. Do you want to know more about these?"
    - text: "We can play one of two games: the memory game or the maths game! Want to know more?"
    - text: "I can play the memory game or the maths game with you, or perhaps both! Which one do you like the sound of?"
    - text: "There are two games you could play: the memory game and the maths game! Should I tell you more about them?"

  utter_explain_memory_game:
    - text: "The memory game goes like this: we take turns to add items to a list of things that we bought at the market!
            Here is a example: Your turn: I went to the market and I bought toys. Then my turn: I went to the market and I bought toys and books. Then its your turn again.
            The list keeps growing to challenge your memory, and the first one between us to make a mistake loses the game! I think you'll love this one."
  
  utter_explain_math_game:
    - text: "The math game goes like this: you start counting from any number, such as one, and you show me how far you can count! We'll keep track of your progress
            to improve your maths skills! This is a great game to show to your friends!"
