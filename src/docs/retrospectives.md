# 2 October 

## Results
- Implemented real-time speech recognition using Wav2Vec
- Implemented response generation using DialoGPT
- Evaluated response generation algorithm with regards to latency, CPU usage, and memory occupancy.

## What Went Well
- We split up the weeks sprint into independent tasks which meant that we could work separately and in our own time, and our tasks were decoupled so that we weren't reliant on each other to finish their work before moving on.
- Used classes to integrate our individual tasks seamlessly
- Stand-ups were valuable because we didn't need to commit too much time to discussions and we were kept in the loop of each other's progress

## What Didn't Go Well
- Too many moving parts in the sprint
- The sprint goal wasn't actually directed at answering the investigation question - investigating and implementing a system that can be used in the production of a **low cost** device, using **low complexity** algorithms.
- We didn't refine the research question well enough, and further, we didn't use that to inform the tasks we needed to achieve in the sprint.
- Lost clarity on what we were trying to achieve so stand-ps, and individual tasks faded away
  
## Going forward into Sprint 2
- Try to define the research question more clearly
- Formalise the tasks 
- Use the research question to inform the formalised tasks
- Keep doing daily stand-ups with the following format
  1. What did you yesterday?
  2. What are you going to do today?
  3. What is blocking you?
